# Examples

There are two example crates, a binary and a library one:
- [Example Binary Crate](https://github.com/bytedream/litbwraw/tree/main/example-binary)
- [Example Library Crate](https://github.com/bytedream/litbwraw/tree/main/example-library)

Each directory has a `nodejs.js` file that can be executed with nodejs and runs the compiled code.
