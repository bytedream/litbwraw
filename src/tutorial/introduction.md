# Tutorial

This tutorial covers how to set up a simple project, adding logic to it and calling it from a Javascript (browser) application.

We will build a simple wasm binary which is able to execute arbitrary Lua input (a repl, basically).

## What will be covered?
- How to set up a project (it's a bit more than just `cargo init`)
- Calling the created wasm file from the browser
